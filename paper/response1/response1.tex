Dear Editor,
\par\null\par\noindent
We thank both reviewers for their time and careful assessments of our
submitted manuscript titled~\textit{Empirical Constraints on the
Nucleosynthesis of Nitrogen.}
We have taken their comments into consideration and updated the document
accordingly; changes from the submitted version are highlighted in red text.
Below you will find our separate responses to both reviewers' comments, with
relevant excerpts in italics.

\par\noindent
We note that this manuscript was reviewed by another referee, and some of the
updates are in response to their comments.
Reviewer 1 raised significant concerns regarding the inclusion of outflows in
the GCE model.
We have made substantial updates to the text to address these points.
Although a number of their comments were partly addressed in the original
manuscript, their response made it clear that these points were not conveyed
with sufficient clarity.
\par
The community is indeed not settled on the importance of galactic winds in GCE
models of Milky Way-like galaxies, largely because of the degeneracy between
the scale of yields and outflows discussed in the paper (and highlighted more
prominently in the revision).
Like the models of, e.g., Schoenrich \& Binney (2009), Andrews et al. (2017),
and Rybizki et al. (2017), our models require significant metal ejection to
reach solar (rather than super-solar) metallicity at late times.
Many other models, such as those mentioned by Reviewer 1, adopt much lower
yields as a result of a steep IMF, and they can evolve to solar metallicity
without outflows.
The mass outflows predicted by galaxy models or hydrodynamic simulations depend
strongly on uncertain assumptions about feedback; for a recent example of
cosmological simulations that produce strong outflows (mass-loading factors of
3.5 - 5) in Milky Way-like galaxies, see Iza et al.'s (2022) analysis of the
Auriga simulations.
\par
Although the scale of yields and importance of outflows are interesting
questions themselves, the [N/O] ratio mainly constrains the ratio of N and O
yields.
In response to Reviewer 1's comments, we have substantially revised our
manuscript to make this point more clearly than before: in particular, we now
frame our primary results in terms of the ratio of the IMF-averaged nitrogen
yields to the IMF-averaged oxygen yields.
We also discuss the degeneracy between yields and outflows in greater detail,
and we state more clearly that our conclusion about upward revisions of the
Cristallo or Ventura yields holds for our fiducial choice of oxygen yield but
can be relaxed for a lower oxygen yield.
\doublebreak
\textit{%
A different choice of the IMF slope would impact deeply the results.
Yet, this issue is surprisingly only briefly mentioned (one sentence, p.18,
l.35) and no effort is spent to investigate quantitatively the IMF issue.
}
\doublebreak
The choice of IMF indeed impacts the computed value of~$\ycc{N}$, but it has
little impact on the ratio~$\ycc{N} / \ycc{O}$ because the massive star yields
of N and O follow similar trends with stellar mass.
We have attached two figures, both of which are variations of Fig. 2 with
steep and shallow variations of the Kroupa (2001) IMF (i.e., power-law indices
at the high-mass end of -2.6 and -2.0 as opposed to -2.3).
In the left panels of these figures, there are variations in the overall
normalization at the factor of~$\sim$2 level.
However, the right panels showing the inferred values of [N/O]$_\text{CC}$ are
nearly unaffected.
\par
Although a change in the IMF could in principle alter the effective DTD by
adjusting the relative numbers of stars of different masses, this choice should
not impact our conclusions regarding AGB star enrichment either.
We advocate for a restitution delay on the order of~$\sim$250 Myr, but we have
not tightly constrained this value.
The impact of the DTD on gas-phase
abundances is negligible, and the impact on stellar abundances is only
noticeable in the limiting cases discussed at the end of section 4.4.
We have updated the text in section 2.1 and included a statement in the new
section 4.7 to clarify this point.
\doublebreak
\textit{%
It would be helpful to analyse the evolution of C as well and see if the
proposed corrections to the published N yields lead to a coherent revision of
the C yields, since the production paths of these two elements in stars are
intimately related...
}
\doublebreak
We wholeheartedly agree -- we have a student working on exactly this project,
and he is currently writing the paper.
We have added a sentence about this to the conclusions.
\doublebreak
\textit{%
From Fig.1 it is seen that most data sets deviate markedly from the [N/O]-[O/H]
trend suggested by Dopita et al. at high metallicities. This is very clear for
the Pilyugin and CHAOS data, but also Belfiore shows a steeply increasing trend
of [N/O] at the highest [O/H] that is not seen in Dopita's trend. May this
affect some of the conclusions? It should also be stated if the ratios are
normalized to the same solar reference.
}
\doublebreak
Indeed, we would infer that N yields should scale super-linearly with
metallicity if we had adopted one of these steeper observational benchmarks.
We have added a statement to this effect in the conclusion as well as in the
new section 4.7.
\doublebreak
\textit{%
The authors use MESA stellar evolutionary models to correct N abundances in
giant stars from APOGEE. For the sake of consistency, they could have also
adopted stellar yields obtained from MESA tracks (e.g. Battino et al. 2021, and
refs therein).
}
\doublebreak
We thank Reviewer 1 for drawing our attention to Battino et al. (2021).
However, these yields are only sampled at two stellar masses and two
metallicities, both of which are significantly sub-solar.
This is unfortunately not densely sampled enough to warrant investigation in
the present manuscript, because the abundance evolution will be highly
dependent on how yields are extrapolated to the full stellar mass range and
(more importantly) to metallicities appropriate for the Milky Way.
\doublebreak
\textit{%
It is unclear how the authors treat the masses of N present at star birth that
are ejected without any nuclear processing. It seems that their description only
refer to newly-produced elements in stars... Regarding their footnote 7, the
yields of Fe for the Ventura's stars should be computed as (m\_ini - m\_remn)
X\_Fe,ini, where m\_ini, m\_remn, and X\_Fe,ini are, respectively, the initial
mass of the star, the mass of the remnant, and the initial Fe abundance. So, no
need to adopt Fe yields from other studies...
}
\doublebreak
We have added references at the beginning of section 2 to our previous papers
as well as the VICE science documentation describing how the return of previous
nucleosynthetic material to the ISM is implemented.
The formalism they allude to is exactly how this recycling is handled.
While other yield tables included in this study find slightly negative Fe
yields, this net destruction is negligible.
We have redacted footnote 7 and modified the text in section 2.2 to simply
state that we do not discuss these yields for this reason.
\doublebreak
\textit{%
Some important references are missing. For instance, when it is stated (p.10)
that "The separation of these evolutionary tracks contests the popular
interpretation that the [N/O]-[O/H] relation arises as an evolutionary
sequence..." the seminal paper by Chiappini et al. (2003) must be quoted (see
their figure 13, and the relevant discussion in their paper). Also, the work of
Tinsley (1979) should be acknowledged when noticing that elements with similar
``restitution delays'' share a similar behaviour (p.14).
}
\doublebreak
We have added these references in sections 4.1 and 4.4, and we thank Reviewer 1
for pointing them out.

\par\noindent
We thank Reviewer 2 for their comments.
The quality of the manuscript has improved markedly by addressing their
concerns.
We thank them in advance for an additional round of considerations.
We also note that this manuscript was reviewed by another referee, and some of
the updates to the manuscript are in response to their comments.
\doublebreak
\textit{%
It is true that the present
work is based on a number of assumptions, which may affect the robustness of the
conclusions reached. For this reason the authors must declare this partial
weakness of the work in the abstract, warning the reader against possible
over-interpretations of the conclusions reached.
}
\doublebreak
We have made substantial updates to our abstract.
The new version better reflects what we believe to be robust conclusions.
In particular, we have normalized our inferred N yields by the adopted O yield.
\doublebreak
\textit{%
1) In the text I see that the authors refer to thermal pulsations instead of
thermal pulses (e.g. page 2, r.c., line 45). Please change
}
\doublebreak
Corrected.
\doublebreak
\textit{%
2) In the introduction the authors comment on the differences among AGB models
from various groups, invoking the treatment of microphysics as possible reason
for that.
Indeed the differences are mostly related to convection and mass loss, which is
more a matter if macrophysics. Please correct
}
\doublebreak
We have simply redacted this term.
\doublebreak
\textit{%
3) Would the authors explain why the approach by Vincenzo et al (second to last
paragraph of the introduction) should work for external galaxies too?
}
\doublebreak
We compare only the stellar abundances of our model against the Vincenzo et al.
(2021) measurements.
While Dopita et al. (2016) present a calibration method for external galaxies,
the sample in Fig. 1 is their calibration sample from local stars and HII
regions, and Vincenzo et al. (2021) find good agreement with those data.
The reason for taking Dopita et al. (2016) is simply that they are
representative of the overall trend.
This and the apparent universality of the trend indicate that our analysis
should extend to external galaxies.
The inferred metallicity dependence of N yields would be slightly super-linear
if we had adopted one of the steeper [N/O]-[O/H] relations from Fig. 1.
We have added a statement to this effect to the conclusion and in the new
section 4.7 summarizing our results.
\doublebreak
\textit{%
Footnote 2 can be deleted. No need to give these details.
}
\doublebreak
Redacted.
\doublebreak
\textit{%
In section 2.1 tha authors use the term ``yield'' for the quantities given by
equation 1.
This term is commonly used for gas or dust mass from single stars. Please give
an alternative term here
}
\doublebreak
There are a number of GCE papers that use ``yield'' to refer to nucleosynthetic
material produced by whole populations of stars.
While we acknowledge the somewhat overloaded terminology, we elect to retain
our current nomenclature to remain consistent with this literature.
\doublebreak
\textit{%
6) The authors should add a short paragraph in section 2.1, to stress that some
rotation of massive stars is required to reproduce the N patterns, although it
is not possible to quantify tightly the rotation rate, based on the present
observational evidence.
}
\doublebreak
The text discusses the need for rotation in some detail already.
We have however added a statement that the rotation rates cannot be tightly
constrained to the second to last paragraph of section 2.1.
\doublebreak
\textit{%
7) When discussing the differences among AGB models (section 2.2, page 5, r.c.,
lines 45-50)
I ask the authors to mention some works where these differences are extensively
discussed and commented: the review by Karakas \& Lattanzio (2014), the papers
Ventura et al. (2018, MNRAS 475, 2282) and Ventura et al. (2016, MNRAS, 457,
1456).
\doublebreak
8) Citations to HBB are lacking. Please add some works e.g. by Sackmann \&
Boothroyd and also Blocker \& Schoenberner
\doublebreak
9) Page 6, second to last paragraph. Note that among the reasons for the
differences
between C11+C15 and the other modellers, the discrepancies among the
temperatures at
the base of the envelope are the dominant ones.
}
\doublebreak
We have adjusted the text in section 2.2 accordingly.
\doublebreak
\textit{%
10) I ask the authors to shorten the discussion on the solar metallicity at the
beginning of page 7. We do not need all the details given
\doublebreak
11) page 7, l.c., line 14. Not only the description of more massive AGB stars are
touched by the description of the opacities. Please change
}
\doublebreak
We have adjusted this text to make it more clear which metallicities and which
masses we are referring to in each sentence.
We however elect to retain the discussion of the solar metallicity as its
downward revision plays an important role in the differences between
the Karakas yields from 2010 at Z = 0.02 and from 2016/2018 at Z = 0.014.
\doublebreak
\textit{%
12) Section 3 provides a detailed description of the chemical evolution model
adopted.
Please keep the main points here, and move the rest to an appendix.
}
\doublebreak
We have done our best to keep the summary of the model concise, but the full
description in Johnson et al. (2021) is nearly 8 pages.
Unfortunately, many of these details are relevant later in the paper.
We therefore elect to keep the current version of section 3.
\doublebreak
\textit{%
13) The ylabel of the left panel of Fig. 4 is unclear. Please change
}
\doublebreak
Adjusted -- the new label is simply ``IMF-weighted N Yields.''
\doublebreak
\textit{%
14) Section 4.2 can be substantially shortened.
}
\doublebreak
Reviewer 1 raised concerns about the content of section 4.2, particularly
4.2.1, which discusses our central result.
We have made adjustments to this text, which are approximately length-neutral
to avoid loss of clarity in addressing their concerns.
\doublebreak
\textit{%
15) In the conclusions, please comment again on the uncertainties (see my first
comment above)
}
\doublebreak
We have made a handful of adjustments to the conclusions in response to both
reviewers' comments.

% The community is indeed settled on neither the proper parametrization nor the

% Reviewer 1 points out a dearth of GCE models in the literature invoking
% outflows to explain the abundance structure of the Milky Way.
% While this paucity can be interpreted as an absence of evidence that outflows
% arise, it is not evidence of their absence.
% Our motivation for including outflows is based on empirical measurements of
% deuterium and helium isotope ratios in the ISM.
% In GCE models, primoridally produced isotopes are sensitive to the strength of
% mass-loading.
% With significant outflows, baryons processed by stars are ejected and replaced
% by accretion at their primordial abundance.
% Without them, these baryons remain in the ISM and their abundance continues to
% increase above the primordial value.
% The measured D/H abundances and the~$^3$He/$^4$He ratio in the Orion Nebula
% indicate that much of the local ISM has not been processed by stars, suggesting
% considerable exchange of gas between the Milky Way and its surroundings.
% For further discussion of these points, we refer Reviewer 1 to Weinberg, 2017,
% ApJ, 851, 25 and Cooke et al., 2022, ApJ, 932, 60.
% Furthermore, there is a long-standing literature on the mass-metallicity
% relation for galaxies that invokes mass-loaded outflows as the origin of its
% slope (see Finlator \& Dave, 2008, MNRAS, 385, 2181; Peeples \& Shankar, 2011,
% MNRAS, 417, 2962; Chisholm, Tremonti \& Leitherer, 2018, MNRAS, 481, 1690).
% \par
% We have clarified our motivation for including outflows at the beginning of
% section 2 and mentioned that we find similar conclusions when we simultaneously
% vary the normalization of our yields and the strength of mass-loading.
% We have added a statement to the introduction that we have been careful to
% ensure our conclusions are not impacted by this assumption as well as other
% GCE parameters.
% We have also added section 4.7 to summarize our main results and clarify a few
% of these key points.

% \\
% ...
% \\
% Off-the-shelf stellar yields come from detailed studies that rest on stellar

% GCE is not a theory (see Tinsley 1980) - it simply offers a framework within

% As a matter of fact, current N yields from massive stars are found to increase
% with metallicity (even a small increase as the one shown in Fig.2, left panel,
% may be important when weighted with the IMF and SFH of the system...).
% The finding by the authors that the yields from low- and intermediate-mass
% stars by Cristallo and Ventura need an upward revision may be simply due to the
% effect of the outflow, which subtracts a fraction of the newly-produced N from
% the ISM. But, as already noted above, other GCE models do not need outflows at
% all to explain the MW data...
% }
% \doublebreak
% Related to Reviewer 1's prior point, we have carefully considered variations in
% the strength of outflows and the normalization of yields.
% As noted in the original text of section 4.2.1 and in the middle panel of Fig.
% 6, we can alternatively lower the strength of outflows and the normalization of
% our SN yields by a factor of 3 and achieve good agreement with the unmodified
% Cristallo yields.
% We find similar results with the Ventura yields, but with a factor of 2.
% We have adjusted the text of section 4.2.1 and added an additional model to the
% middle panel of Fig. 6 and adjusted the legend to make this point more clear.
% We also draw Reviewer 1's attention to section 4.6, which casts the [N/O]-[O/H]
% relation as an equilibrium phenomenon.
% The strength of outflows (i.e., the value of~$\eta$) cancels in equation 12,
% leaving behind only a ratio of yields as free parameters.
% This cancellation is the primary reason why our central result regarding the
% metallicity dependence of N yields should be independent of this assumption.
% We have adjusted the text throughout to emphasize more clearly that we have
% constrained only the metallicity dependence of the relative yields of N and O,
% and we thank Reviewer 1 for pointing out that this point was not clearly
% conveyed in the original manuscript.
