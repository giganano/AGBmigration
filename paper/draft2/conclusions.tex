\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

Building on the multi-zone GCE model of~\citet{Johnson2021}, which reproduces
many observed features of the [$\alpha$/Fe]-[Fe/H]-age distribution of Milky
Way disc stars, we have inferred empirical constraints on the stellar
nucleosynthesis of N by comparing model predictions to observed gas-phase trends
in extenal galaxies and stellar trends in the Milky Way disc.
In our models, the gas-phase abundance at a given Galactocentric radius first
evolves to higher~\oh~at roughly constant~\no~because of primary
(metallicity-independent) N production, then evolves upward in~\no~with slowly
increasing~\oh~because of secondary N production that increases with
metallicity (Fig.~\ref{fig:no_oh_timeevol}).
The~\ohno~relation reaches an approximate equilibrium after~$t = 5 - 8$ Gyr,
consistent with previous arguments that this relation is largely
redshift-independent~\citep{Vincenzo2018, HaydenPawson2021}.
This~\ohno~relation represents a superposition of evolutionary track endpoints
rather than an evolutionary track itself, similar to some explanations of the
low-$\alpha$ disc sequence in the Milky Way~\citep[e.g.][]{Schoenrich2009,
Nidever2014, Buck2020, Sharma2021, Johnson2021}.
\par
As our principal observational benchmark, we take Dopita et
al.'s (\citeyear{Dopita2016}) characterization of observed gas-phase abundances
in external galaxies (see Fig.~\ref{fig:no_oh_observed}).
Using Johnson et al.'s (\citeyear{Johnson2021}) CCSN oxygen yield
of~$\ycc{O} = 0.015$, we obtain agreement with
the~\citet{Dopita2016}~\ohno~relation if we assume a metallicity-independent
massive star yield of~$\ycc{N} = 3.6\times10^{-4}$ and an AGB fractional N
yield that is linear in stellar mass and metallicity
(equation~\ref{eq:linear_yield}) with~$\xi = 9\times10^{-4}$.
This value of~$\ycc{N}$ is consistent with the rotating massive star models of
\citet{Limongi2018}, and we concur with previous arguments that rotating massive
stars are required to explain the~$\no \approx -0.7$ plateau observed at low
metallicities (see Fig.~\ref{fig:no_oh_observed};~\citealp{Chiappini2003,
Chiappini2005, Chiappini2006, Kobayashi2011, Prantzos2018, Grisoni2021}).
The AGB yield is similar in form but 3 times higher in amplitude than the
models of~\cristallo.
\par
With~$\ycc{O} = 0.015$ and~$\ycc{N} = 3.6\times10^{-4}$, the AGB N yields
of~\cristallo~or~\ventura~must be amplifieid by factors of three and two,
respectively, to achieve agreement with the~\citet{Dopita2016}~\ohno~relation
(Fig.~\ref{fig:no_oh_predictions}).
However, as predicted abundance ratios depend primarily on yield ratios, we can
also obtain agreement by using the~\cristallo~or~\ventura~yields and
lowering~\ycc{O}~and~\ycc{N}~by the corresponding factor.
Such a change could be physically justified if black hole formation is more
extensive, or the IMF steeper, than implicitly assumed by the value
of~$\ycc{O} = 0.015$ (see~\S~\ref{sec:results:yields:variations}
and~\citealp{Griffith2021a}).
Other successful predictions of the~\citet{Johnson2021} models, including the
Galactic~\oh~gradient that is one of its basic constraints, would be largely
unchanged if~\ycc{Fe},~\yia{Fe}, and outflow mass loading efficiencies~$\eta$
were all reduced by the same factor.
Alternatively, one could retain a higher~\ycc{O}~and~\ycc{N}~but assume that
Galactic winds preferentially eject CCSN products relative to AGB products, as
suggested by~\citet{Vincenzo2016a}.
The degeneracy between the overall scaling of yields and the magnitude of
outflows is one of the key sources of uncertainty in GCE models.
\par
In contrast to~\cristallo~and~\ventura, the AGB models
of~\karakasten~and~\karakas~predict IMF-averaged yields that are decreasing or
approximately flat with increasing~$Z$ (Fig.~\ref{fig:ssp}).
In our GCE models, these yields lead to clear disagreement with the
\citet{Dopita2016} trend, even when we allow reasonable variations in the
metallicity dependence of~\ycc{N} (Fig.~\ref{fig:no_oh_predictions}).
There are many uncertain physical effects in AGB stellar models, so it is
difficult to pinpoint a single cause for this discrepancy.
In general, the most efficient N production occurs when both TDU and HBB occur
simultaneously because each replenishment of C and O isotopes from the stellar
core by TDU adds new seed nuclei for HBB to process in~\Nfourteen~via the CNO
cycle~\citep{Ventura2013}.
The distinctive metallicity dependence of the~\karakasten~and~\karakas~yields
traces back to the simultaneous occurrence of TDU and HBB over a substantial
mass range at all metallicities (Fig.~\ref{fig:agb_yield_models}).
\par
All of the AGB models predict that IMF-averaged N production is dominated by
stars with M~$> 2~\msun$ (Fig.~\ref{fig:ssp}).
As a result, the delay time required to produce 50\% of the AGB N is 250 Myr or
less, shorter than the~$\sim$1 Gyr characteristic delay of Fe fron SN Ia.
The form of the~\ohno~relation is driven by the metallicity dependence of N
yields, not by the time delay of AGB production (Fig.~\ref{fig:t_z_dep_comp}).
\par
To investigate the sources of scatter in the~\ohno~relation, we construct
variants of our fiducial model that have~$\sim$40\% sinusoidal oscillations in
the SFR with a 2 Gyr period, induced by oscillations in either the SFE or the
gas infall rate.
The combined effects of dilution by pristine infall and metallicity-dependent N
production lead to oscillations in the~\ohno~relation comparable in magnitude
to the scatter measured in MaNGA galaxies by~\citet{Schaefer2020}
(Fig.~\ref{fig:schaefer_comp}).
We concur with their conclusion that variations in the SFE can plausibly
explain most of the observed scatter.
\citet{Johnson2021} find that stellar migration induces stochastic variations
in [$\alpha$/Fe] enrichment because a stellar population can migrate from its
birth radius before most of its SN Ia Fe production takes place.
The same effect occurs for AGB N enrichment but to a lesser extent because the
shorter production timescale ($\sim$250 Myr) leaves less time for migration.
We find that migration leads to~$\sim$0.05-dex scatter in~\no~at fixed~\oh,
which is smaller than the scatter measured by~\citet{Schaefer2020} but not
negligible.
\par
Our findings illustrate the value and methodology of empirically constraining
stellar yields by combining general theoretical expectations with GCE modelling
and observational constraints.
For the case of N, we have used the expectation that massive stars and AGB stars
both contribute, with the AGB contribution moderately delayed in time.
The metallicity dependence of the combined IMF-averaged yield is tightly
constrained, and it is plausibly partitioned into a massive star yield that is
independent of metallicity and an AGB yield that is linear in metallicity~$Z$
and progenitor mass~$M$.
The normalization of the yield is well-constrained~\textit{relative} to the
IMF-averaged O yield.
The DTD predicted by our fiducial model, in concert with the~\citet{Johnson2021}
GCE prescriptions, leads to good agreement with the~\no-age and~\no-\ofe~trends
for Milky Way disc stars (Fig.~\ref{fig:vincenzo_comp}).
As this approach is extended to increasing numbers of elements, the web of
yield constraints and consistency tests will become steadily more powerful,
providing valuable insights on stellar astrophysics, SN physics, and the
history of our Galaxy.

% We have made use of the GCE models from~\citet{Johnson2021} which characterize
% the Milky Way disc as a series of concentric rings with a uniform width
% $\delta\rgal = 100$ pc.
% As in previous models with similar motivations~\citep{Matteucci1989,
% Wyse1989, Prantzos1995, Schoenrich2009, Minchev2013, Minchev2014, Minchev2017,
% Sharma2021}, this model treats each individual ring as a conventional one-zone
% model of chemical evolution.
% The novel addition to this model, however, is that it takes into account the
% impact that radial migration has on enrichment rates by allowing stellar
% populations to enrich distributions of radii as they migrate.
% We retained the IMF-averaged SN yields of O and Fe from~\citet{Johnson2021},
% who in turn base these values off of~\citet{Weinberg2017} and
% \citet{Johnson2020}.
% Assuming that the N yield from SNe Ia is negligible, we have investigated
% theoretical and empirical N yields from both massive stars and AGB stars.
% \par
% If our fiducial CCSN yield of O is accurate ($\ycc{O} = 0.015$), then the CCSN
% yield of N required to reproduce the ``plateau'' of~$\no\subcc = -0.7$ at
% low~\oh~is~$\ycc{N} = 3.6\times10^{-4}$.
% These values of both~\ycc{N}~and~\no\subcc~are consistent with the rotating
% CCSN models of~\citet{Limongi2018}.
% N yields computed for non-rotating, lower metallicity progenitors are much
% smaller than their rotating counterparts~\citep[see
% Fig.~\ref{fig:n_cc_yields};][]{Woosley1995, Nomoto2013, Sukhbold2016,
% Limongi2018}.
% This suggests that the effects of rotation are necessary to explain the N
% abundances seen at low~\oh, consistent with recent arguments
% from~\citet{Grisoni2021}.
% \par
% Various AGB star nucleosynthesis models predict qualitatively different yields
% of N as a function of progenitor mass and metallicity (see
% Fig.~\ref{fig:agb_yield_models}).
% Ascertaining the origin of these differences is difficult because each model
% folds in different assumptions regarding important evolutionary parameters such
% as mass loss, opacities of various isotopic species, convection and convective
% boundaries, and nuclear reaction networks (see discussion in, e.g.,~\S~5
% of~\citealp{Karakas2016}).
% Nonetheless the differences between yield models can be qualitatively
% understood by considering the differences between how TDU and HBB proceed in
% the stellar models.
% In general, the most efficient N production occurs when both TDU and HBB
% occur simultaneously because each replenishment of C and O isotopes from the
% stellar core by TDU add new seed nuclei for HBB to process into~\Nfourteen~via
% the CNO cycle~\citep{Ventura2013}.
% Different assumptions regarding mass loss and opacity can also impact the
% duration of a star's AGB phase, inducing secondary effects on the N yields.
% \par
% Similar to previous theoretical arguments regarding the low [$\alpha$/Fe] stars
% in the Milky Way disc~\citep[e.g.][]{Schoenrich2009, Nidever2014, Buck2020,
% Sharma2021, Johnson2021}, we find that with a smooth SFH the~\ohno~relation
% arises not out of an evolutionary sequence but as a superposition of endpoints.
% That is, the time evolution of each Galactic region through the~\ohno~plane
% is not the same line as the~\ohno~relation that would be observed at the
% present day in our model Galaxy (see Fig.~\ref{fig:no_oh_timeevol}).
% We additionally find that our model predicts the gas-phase~\ohno~relation to be
% relatively time-independent up to lookback times of~$\sim6 - 8$ Gyr, consistent
% with previous arguments that the relation is largely redshift-independent
% \citep{Vincenzo2018, HaydenPawson2021}.
% \par
% Our fiducial model uses AGB star yields which are linear in both mass and
% metallicity with a slope of~$\xi = 9\times10^{-4}$ (see
% equation~\ref{eq:linear_yield}).
% This is a factor of~$2 - 3$ higher than the~\cristallo~and~\ventura~yields, but
% with a similar metallicity dependence.
% The fiducial model successfully reproduces the~\ohno~relation as observed, but
% the~\cristallo~and~\ventura~yield models require an artificial amplification by
% factors of 3 and 2, respectively.
% However, these yield models are successful if we instead simultaneously lower
% our SN yields from~\citet{Johnson2021} and the outflow mass loading factor
% $\eta$ at all radii by similar factors (see Fig.~\ref{fig:no_oh_predictions}).
% This is physically plausible if a substantial fraction of high mass stars
% collapse to black holes instead of ending their lives as CCSNe.
% Although there is presently no combination of a massive star nucleosynthesis
% model and a physically motivated black hole landscape able to reproduce the
% observed abundance patterns~\citep{Griffith2021a}, extensive black hole
% formation still lowers SN yields by simply robbing the yield of the ejecta
% from stars of various initial masses.
% This suggests that either N nucleosynthesis in AGB stars must be more efficient 
% or that a substantial fraction of~$M \gtrsim 8~\msun$ stars must produce
% failed supernova; the answer may also be a combination of the two.
% \par
% With both the~\karakasten~and~\karakas~AGB star yields, our model is
% unable to reproduce the monotonic increase of~\no~with~\oh~as observed.
% This discrepancy persists if we consider alternate parametrizations of the
% CCSN yield of N as suggested by the non-rotating models of
% \citet{Woosley1995},~\citet{Nomoto2013},~\citet{Sukhbold2016}, and
% \citet{Limongi2018}.
% In general, we find that reproducing the~\ohno~relation requires the total N
% yield from CCSNe and AGB stars to scale roughly linearly with the progenitor
% metallicity~$Z$.
% Our model has sufficient success modeling the primary component of the N yield
% as a metallicity independent~\ycc{N} as suggested by CCSN models with rotating
% progenitors and a secondary component described by an AGB star yield of N which
% scales roughly linearly with~$Z$, but there is some room for trade-off
% between these two enrichment channels because our model best constrains the sum
% of the two.
% Our linear yield model as well as the~\cristallo~and~\ventura~models
% qualitatively reproduce this scaling, which we illustrate in Fig.~\ref{fig:ssp}.
% The normalization of the AGB star yields, however, depends on the SN yields and
% the efficiency of outflows as discussed in~\S~\ref{sec:results:yields}.
% \par
% To test our model against N abundances observed in stars, we make use of the
% measurements presented in~\citet{Vincenzo2021} with asteroseismic mass
% measurements.
% To estimate birth abundances of N, they use~\texttt{MESA} stellar evolution
% models~\citep{Paxton2011, Paxton2013, Paxton2015, Paxton2018} to correct the
% spectroscopically derived measurements for internal mixing processes known to
% affect the photospheric abundances of N in evolved stars (i.e. dredge-up of
% CNO cycle products;~\citealp{Gilroy1989, Korn2007, Lind2008, Souto2018,
% Souto2019}).
% They find that~\no~at fixed~\feh~is relatively age-independent, a result
% which our model successfully reproduces (see Fig.~\ref{fig:vincenzo_comp}).
% This is a notable success of our model and the~\citet{Vincenzo2021} estimates
% because with uncorrected N abundances,~\no~at fixed~\feh~shows an inverse
% dependence on stellar age (see their Fig. 7).
% Additionally, our model predicts~\no~to increase with decreasing~\ofe~in
% agreement with~\citet{Vincenzo2021}.
% This suggests that the chemical dichotomy between the thin and thick discs
% persists even when using birth abundances of N (for details on the Galaxy's two
% chemical populations, see discussion in, e.g.,~\citealp{Hayden2015,
% Weinberg2019, Weinberg2021, Griffith2021b}).
% Both of these results arise out of a correlation between~\nh~and~\feh~in the
% ISM predicted by the model, whereas the relation between~\nh~and~\oh~is much
% weaker up to lookback times of~$\sim$10 Gyr.
% This gives rise to both the flat nature of the~\no-age relation at
% fixed~\feh~and the inverse relationship between~\no~and~\ofe~(see
% Fig.~\ref{fig:vincenzo_comp} and discussion
% in~\S~\ref{sec:results:vincenzo_comp}).
% \par
% To investigate the sources of scatter in the~\ohno~relation, we construct two
% variations of the fiducial model from~\citet{Johnson2021}.
% In these alternate scenarios, we specify the accretion history of the
% Galaxy rather than the star formation history and impose sinusoidal oscillations
% on either the SFE or the accretion history itself.
% We choose an amplitude of 50\% in the SFE because it is comparable to the
% observationally derived scatter in molecular gas depletion
% times~\citep{Tacconi2018}.
% We set the amplitude to 75\% for our oscillatory accretion history model because
% the resultant variability in the SFR is of similar magnitude to the variable
% SFE model ($\sim$40\%).
% In general, we find that these oscillations induce variability in the
% gas-phase~\no~ratio at fixed~\oh~that is a factor of~$\sim$2 larger than that
% caused by stellar migration.
% This is a consequence of the quick production timescale of N by single stellar
% populations ($\sim$ 250 Myr, see Fig.~\ref{fig:ssp} and discussion
% in~\S~\ref{sec:yields:imf_agb}): there simply is not much time for orbits to
% dynamically evolve before most of a stellar population's N is ejected to the
% ISM.
% Our oscillatory models predict changes in~\no~at fixed~\oh~that are comparable
% to the scatter in the relation derived observationally by~\citet{Schaefer2020}
% using data from the MaNGA IFU survey~\citep{Bundy2015}.
% They demonstrate that this scatter is correlated with variations in the local
% SFE, with lower SFE system exhibiting higher~\no~at fixed~\oh.
% Our chemical evolution models successfully reproduce this result, additionally
% suggesting that migration plays a sub-dominant but nonetheless significant
% role in driving scatter in the~\ohno~relation.
% \par
% When weighted by the IMF~\citep{Kroupa2001}, the~\cristallo~yields predict
% roughly equal contributions per linear dM$_\text{ZAMS}$ interval.
% Each additional model shows a substantially higher contribution from AGB stars
% with masses of~$\gtrsim$3~\msun.
% In all cases, the characteristic delay times for production by single stellar
% populations are~$\lesssim$250 Myr.
% This is true even for the~\cristallo~yields because of the steep nature of the
% stellar mass-lifetime relation: most of the mass range of stars that will go
% through an AGB phase within the age of the universe will do so within a few
% hundred Myr of their formation.
% The DTD of N production by AGB stars is therefore quite prompt, and although it
% does affect the stellar abundances (see discussion
% in~\S~\ref{sec:results:vincenzo_comp}), the metallicity dependence plays a much
% larger role in establishing the~\ohno~relation as observed.
% Due to the relatively prompt nature of N enrichment, stellar migration has a
% minimal impact on N enrichment rates.
% As demonstrated in~\S~\ref{sec:results:schaefer_comp} in comparison to the
% measurements by~\citet{Schaefer2020}, they impact the gas-phase~\no~ratio at
% only the~$\sim$0.05 dex level.
% If the DTD were more extended, there would be more time for dynamical evolution
% before nucleosynthetic products are deposited to the ISM, and migration would
% consequently have a more substantial impact on enrichment rates; this indeed
% appears to be the case for SN Ia production of Fe (see discussion
% in~\S~\ref{sec:results:fiducial} and in~\S\S~3.1 and 3.4
% of~\citealp{Johnson2021}).
% \par
% % The small impact of stellar migration on N enrichment rates is the opposite of
% % what~\citet{Johnson2021} find for SN Ia enrichment of Fe.
% % Because the SN Ia DTD has a characteristic delay time closer to~$\sim$1 Gyr
% % and a significant tail to longer values, a substantial fraction of Fe
% % production occurs on timescales similar to the migration timescale in this
% % model.
% % Consequently, the impact on enrichment rates is much stronger for Fe (as high
% % as a factor of~$\sim$3 at~$\rgal \gtrsim 9$ kpc; see discussion in~\S\S~3.1 and
% % 3.4 of~\citealp{Johnson2021}).
% % When there is a deficit or surplus of SN Ia events sustained for a
% % sufficiently long time, the gas-phase Fe abundance increases or decreases
% % accordingly, and the stars that form during these phases inherit elevated or
% % depressed [$\alpha$/Fe] ratios as a result.
% % This effect is strong enough to potentially explain the intrinsically young
% % sub-component of the young~$\alpha$-rich stars observed in the solar
% % neighbourhood (see discussion in~\S~\ref{sec:results:fiducial};
% % \citealp{Chiappini2015, Martig2015, Martig2016,
% % Jofre2016, Yong2016, Izzard2018, SilvaAguirre2018, Warfield2021}.
% % Although our model suggests that the impact may be larger when the Galaxy was
% % young, this effect is only at the~$\sim$0.05 dex level for N (see
% % Fig.~\ref{fig:no_oh_timeevol}).
% % This difference underscores the argument from~\citet{Johnson2021} that stellar
% % migration has a stronger impact on enrichment rates for elements with longer
% % characteristic delay times on their production, and that this can present in
% % stellar data as seemingly anomalous abundance ratios at fixed age.
% \par
% The results outlined in this paper highlight the importance of empirically
% calibrated yields of all elements from all nucleosynthetic sources in GCE
% models.
% The combination of theoretically predicted yields and flexible computational
% tools such as~\vice~can provide powerful constraints for future models of
% elemental production and galaxy evolution.
% When future spectroscopic surveys begin collecting data, studies such as this
% will be essential to illuminating the lessons they can teach us about the
% history of nuclear reactions in our home Galaxy.
