\section{Data Availability}
\vice~is open-source software.
The code which numerically integrates the~\citet{Johnson2021} GCE models is
also publicly available and can be found in~\vice's GitHub repository.
The sample of star particles from~\hsim~is available through~\vice, which will
download the files automatically the first time it needs them.
The rest of the data from~\hsim~can be accessed
at~\url{https://nbody.shop/data.html}.
Observational data taken from the literature~\citep[e.g.][]{Dopita2016,
Schaefer2020, Vincenzo2021} will be provided upon request to the corresponding
author.
