Our fiducial model adopts, together with the SN yields of
\citet[][see discussion in~\S~\ref{sec:yields:ccsne}]{Johnson2021},
$y_\text{N}^\text{CC} = 3.6\times10^{-4}$ and our linear AGB star yield model
with~$\xi = 9\times10^{-4}$.
Although we presented this model in comparison to the~\cristallo~yields with
$\xi = 3\times10^{-4}$ in~\S~\ref{sec:yields:agb}, we find that a
renormalization of this model is necessary to reproduce the~\ohno~relation as
observed with the~\citet{Johnson2021} GCE model.
We discuss this point further in~\S~\ref{sec:results:yields}.
To demonstrate the impact of stellar migration on N enrichment rates, we make
use of the ``diffusion'' migration model in this section (see discussion
in~\S~\ref{sec:multizone}).
\par
In the left panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:no_oh_timeevol}, we plot the evolution of N
and O abundances in the gas phase at five different Galactocentric radii.
At early times,~\oh~is low and~\no~reflects the ratio of the CCSN yields
(\no\subcc~$\approx -0.7$).
Consequently, the tracks in each ring are similar.
Once lower mass stars begin to evolve through an AGB phase, they enrich the
interstellar medium (ISM) with N but negligible amounts of O, increasing~\no.
At this point, the tracks in each ring separate from one another.
This separation is a consequence of the metallicity gradient in~\oh~being
established early in the Galaxy's evolution.
Being an element produced primarily by CCSNe on short delay times, O reaches
an equilibrium abundances on timescales of a~$\sim$few Gyr~\citep{Weinberg2017}.
Each ring therefore achieves equilibrium in O soon after AGB stars begin
producing N, after which~\no~continues to increase at an approximately
fixed~\oh.
The separation of these evolutionary tracks further suggests that
the~\ohno~relation arises not as an evolutionary sequence but as a
superposition of endpoints.
That is, the relation that would be derived observationally for this model
taking the N and O abundances at the present day from all rings (shown by the
dotted black line; see discussion below) does not reflect the N and O
abundances of the Galaxy in the past.
Similar arguments have been made regarding low [$\alpha$/Fe] disc stars
\citep[e.g.][]{Schoenrich2009, Sharma2021}.
\par
Because there is a delay between a stellar population's formation and N
production from its AGB stars ($\sim$250 Myr in this model; see Fig.
\ref{fig:ssp}), stellar migration can in principle occur within this time
interval.
Although the bulk of migration occurs on longer timescales, this characteristic
delay is comparable to the dynamical time of the Milky Way and is thus adequate
for kinematic heating to at least begin.
As a consequence, there may be a slight deficit or surplus of N-producing AGB
stars in a given ring at some time induced by stellar migration.
These tracks can thus move vertically in this plane in response to AGB stars
moving between rings as the Galaxy evolves, entirely independent of the SFH and
the nucleosynthetic yields of stars than formed at a given radius and time.
We demonstrate this effect by comparing the solid blue and purple lines to
their dotted counterparts, which denote the tracks when we neglect the impact
of stellar migration on enrichment rates (i.e. the ``post-processing'' model
from~\citealp{Johnson2021}).
\par
In the right panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:no_oh_timeevol}, we plot the
gas-phase~\ohno~relation predicted by the model at various snapshots.
To obtain this, we simply take the N and O abundances in the ISM at a given
output time for each~$\delta\rgal = 100$ pc ring at~$\rgal > 2$ kpc and plot
them as a line.
The relation is generally time-independent at~$T \gtrsim 5$ Gyr.
Although there is some slight evolution toward higher~\no, the total change
in~\no~over this time interval is well within the intrinsic scatter derived
observationally (see Fig.~\ref{fig:no_oh_observed}).
Even at~$T = 2$ Gyr at a redshift of~$z \approx 2.6$ (when the universe was
2.5 Gyr old as our model places the onset of star formation 500 Myr following
the big bang; see discussion in~\S~2.1 of~\citealp{Johnson2021}),~\no~at
fixed~\oh~is only~$\sim$0.2 dex lower than its value at the present day.
Especially when considering the intrinsic scatter that would arise if we were
to consider models with, e.g., different SFHs, this supports the notion that
the~\ohno~relation has at most a weak dependence on redshift
\citep{Vincenzo2018, HaydenPawson2021}.
\par
We again demonstrate the impact of stellar migration in the right panel of
Fig.~\ref{fig:no_oh_predictions} by comparing the blue and purple solid lines
to their dotted counterparts, which quantify the relation when we neglect
stellar migration.
This indicates that the complex features seen in the relation at all times are
a consequence of migration as discussed above.
The mechanism by which stellar migration imposes complex features in
the~\ohno~plane is qualitatively similar to what~\citet{Johnson2021} find for
SN Ia production of Fe (see discussion in their~\S\S~3.1 and 3.4).
They found that the SN Ia rate in this model can vary by as much as a factor of
$\sim$3 at large radii ($\rgal \gtrsim 9$ kpc).
As a consequence, some of the resultant stellar populations are Fe-poor enough
to present as young stars ($\lesssim$ 6 Gyr) with significantly super-solar
[$\alpha$/Fe] ratios.
Stars with these ages and chemical compositions have indeed been observed in
the solar neighbourhood with APOGEE\footnote{
	Apache Point Observatory Galaxy Evolution Experiment~\citep{Majewski2017}.
}~\citep{Chiappini2015, Martig2015, Martig2016, Warfield2021}.
Although a substantial portion of these stars appear to have undergone mass
transfer from a binary companion, making them appear younger than they truly
are~\citep{Jofre2016, Yong2016, Izzard2018, SilvaAguirre2018, Miglio2021}, some
exhibit [C/N] ratios consistent with truly young ages~\citep{Hekker2019}.
\citet{Johnson2021} argue that the impact of stellar migration on enrichment
rates is responsible for this intrinsically young sub-component.
In the case of N, the effect is much smaller ($\lesssim$ 0.1 dex in~\no),
but Fig.~\ref{fig:no_oh_timeevol} suggests there are some instances at early
times where the effect is more substantial.
This arises because our model predicts N yields to be ejected from stellar
populations~$\sim$5 times faster than Fe (even faster in our alternate yield
models with larger contributsion from high mass AGB stars; see Fig.
\ref{fig:ssp} and discussion in~\S~\ref{sec:yields:imf_agb}).
Consequently, there is much less time for stellar migration to occur within the
timescale of N production than there is within the timescale of Fe production.
This underscores the argument from~\citet{Johnson2021} that in order for
nucleosynthetic yields to migrate significant distances along with their
progenitor stellar populations, the timescale for production needs to be at
least comparable to the migration timescale.

\ref{sec:results:yields}).

discussion in~\S~\ref{sec:multizone}).
}
\label{fig:no_oh_predictions}
\end{figure*}

We use the~\citet{Dopita2016} measurements as our observational benchmark.
They are a good representation of many results for gas phase N and O abundances
(see Fig.~\ref{fig:no_oh_observed}), and they agree well with APOGEE stellar
trends~\citep{Vincenzo2021}.
To make the comparison between different yield models more clear, we neglect
the impact of stellar migration on enrichment rates and make use of the
``post-processing'' migration model in this section (see discussion
in~\S~\ref{sec:multizone}).
\par
In the left panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:no_oh_predictions}, we compare the
predictions of our multi-zone GCE model with each of the AGB star yield tables
predicted from stellar evolution models (see Fig.~\ref{fig:agb_yield_models}
and discussion in~\S~\ref{sec:yields:agb}).
Since it is based on the~\cristallo~yields, we find similar results with our
linear model with a slope of~$\xi = 3\times10^{-4}$.
All four AGB star yield models fail to reproduce the gas-phase~\ohno~relation
as observed.
The~\cristallo~and~\ventura~yields are able to reproduce the qualitative trend,
but with an incorrect normalization.
The~\karakasten~and~\karakas~yields, on the other hand, fail to reproduce
the steadily sloped increase of~\no~with~\oh.
\par
In order to successfully reproduce the observations, we find that we need to
artificially amplify the~\cristallo~and~\ventura~yields by factors of~$\sim$3
and~$\sim$2, respectively.
Having originally compared our linear model to the~\cristallo~yields in
Fig.~\ref{fig:agb_yield_models} with a slope of~$\xi = 3\times10^{-4}$, we
amplify this value by a factor of 3 here as well.
We illustrate the results of these modified yield models in the middle panel
of Fig.~\ref{fig:no_oh_predictions}.
Although the~\ventura~model predicts an~\ohno~relation that is slightly
shallower than the~\citet{Dopita2016} measurements, the predictions are
reasonably within the scatter seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:no_oh_observed}.
Rather than artificially amplifying the~\cristallo~and~\ventura~yields, we also
find good agreement with the observed relation if we lower both our SN yields
and our outflow mass loading factor~$\eta$ as a function of~\rgal~by similar
factors from their values in~\citet{Johnson2021}.
These parameters, which approximately determine the equilibrium abundance in a
one-zone model~\citep{Weinberg2017}, are tuned to reproduce a metallicity
gradient in the disc that resembles that observed for the Milky Way (see
discussion in~\S~2.4 of~\citealp{Johnson2021}).
However, since the yield and the outflow are simply source and sink terms in
computing enrichment rates, the model makes similar predictions when both are
lowered by the same factor.
We demonstrate this point in the middle panel of Fig.
\ref{fig:no_oh_predictions} with the black dashed line for the~\cristallo~model
with both~\ycc{O}~and~$\eta$ each lowered by a factor of 3.
This model spans a different range in~\oh~because the relation between~\ycc{O},
$\eta$, and the equilibrium abundance is only approximately one-to-one, but the
predictions also exhibit good agreement with the~\citet{Dopita2016}
measurements.
\par
Lowering our SN yields by a factor of~$2 - 3$ is plausible if a substantial
fraction of massive stars collapse directly to black holes as opposed to
exploding as SNe at the ends of their lives.
Our IMF-averaged massive star yields (see discussion in~\S
\ref{sec:yields:ccsne}) are based on a~\citet{Kroupa2001} IMF combined with SN
nucleosynthesis models in which most~$M > 8~\msun$ stars explode as a CCSN
\cite[e.g.][]{Woosley1995, Chieffi2004, Chieffi2013, Limongi2018, Nomoto2013},
but recent results contest the validity of this assumption.
The criteria for massive star explosions and which stars of what masses end
their lives in ``failed supernovae'' has been a recent topic of interest from
both theoretical~\citep[e.g.][]{Pejcha2015, Sukhbold2016, Ertl2016} and
observational perspectives (e.g.~\citealp*{Gerke2015};~\citealp{Adams2017,
Basinger2021}).
At present, no combination of a SN nucleosynthesis model with a physically
motivated black hole landscape is able to reproduce the observed abundance
patterns~\citep{Griffith2021a}.
Despite this, black hole formation still lowers SN yields by simply not
producing explosive nucleosynthetic products and is thus an alternate
explanation for the failure of our fiducial model to reproduce the
observed~\ohno~relation with the~\cristallo~and~\ventura~yield models.
With~\vice's~\texttt{vice.yields.ccsne.fractional} function, designed to
calculate values of~\ycc{X}~for various elements (see discussion in~\S
\ref{sec:yields:ccsne} here and in~\S~4 of~\citealp{Griffith2021a}), we indeed
find a value of~$\ycc{O} = 0.0056$ using the W18 explosion model from
\citet{Sukhbold2016} compared to our fiducial value of~$\ycc{O} = 0.015$.
\par
Alternatively,~\citet{Vincenzo2016a} are able to reproduce the~\ohno~relation
in chemical evolution models with the~\ventura~yields by implementing a
differential wind in which outflows remove O but not N from the star forming
gas reservoir.
Because the enrichment rates are the same as in our models with lowered SN
yields, we again find similar results if simply add a portion of the SN yields
(both CCSN and SN Ia) to the outflow while still lowering~$\eta$ at all radii.
If SNe are the sources of outflow-driving winds, such a scenario is suggested
by recent observational~\citep*{Chisholm2018} and theoretical arguments
\citep{Christensen2018}, and could also account for this difference in our
fiducial model if AGB stars do not significantly contribute to driving outflows.
\par
With the~\karakasten~and~\karakas~models failing to reproduce the qualitative
trend of~\no~with~\oh, none of the variations discussed above in the
context of the~\cristallo~and~\ventura~yields are able to reproduce the
observed results.
Each of these alternate parameterizations corresponds to a renormalization of
the predicted~\ohno~relation, and with inaccurate slopes, there is no factor by
which the predicted~\no~ratios predicted by either~\karakasten~or~\karakas~can
be amplified or diminished in order to accurately explain the data.
However, in principle it is possible that a metallicity-dependent CCSN yield of
N could make up the difference.
\par
If the~\karakasten~yields are to reproduce the observations, the overall N
abundance must decrease at low~\oh~and increase at high~\oh.
We therefore construct the following parameterization of~\ycc{N}:
\begin{equation}
\ycc{N} = (3.6\times10^{-4})\left(\frac{Z}{Z_\odot}\right),
\label{eq:linear_yncc}
\end{equation}
where~$Z_\odot$ is the total metallicity of the sun, for which we take a value
of~$Z = 0.014$ based on the findings of~\citet{Asplund2009} and
\citet*{Asplund2021}.
We illustrate this CCSN yield model with the slanted black dotted line in the
left hand panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:n_cc_yields}.
While our fiducial value of~$\ycc{N} = 3.6\times10^{-4}$ best describes the
rotating CCSN progenitor models of~\citet{Limongi2018}, this alternate
parameterization follows the non-rotating models published in
\citet{Limongi2018},~\citet{Sukhbold2016},~\citet{Nomoto2013}, and
\citet{Woosley1995} while maintaing the same base-line value of
$3.6\times10^{-4}$ at solar metallicity.
If the~\karakas~yields are to reproduce the observations, then contrary to the
predictions made with the~\karakasten~yields, the~\no~ratio at low~\oh~is
fine (albeit slightly high by~$\sim$0.2 dex).
Instead, only the N abundance at high~\oh~needs correcting.
We therefore construct a second alternate form of~\ycc{N}~by retaining the
value of the fiducial yield at sub-solar metallicity but assuming the value of
equation~\refp{eq:linear_yncc} at super-solar abundances:
\begin{equation}
\ycc{N} = (3.6\times10^{-4})\max\left(1, \frac{Z}{Z_\odot}\right).
\label{eq:broken_yncc}
\end{equation}
\par
We compare our GCE model predictions with these alternate CCSN yield
parameterizations for the~\karakasten~and~\karakas~AGB star yield models in
the right-hand panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:no_oh_predictions}.
These metallicity-dependent CCSN yields are able to make up some of the
difference, but both models still predict an~\ohno~relation that is simply
too shallow to explain the observations.
The inverse dependence of~\no~with~\oh~with our fiducial CCSN yield and
the~\karakasten~AGB star yields can be understood by the interaction between
TDU and HBB (see discussion in~\S~\ref{sec:yields:agb}).
Both effects are stronger at low metallicity, and since all of
the~\karakasten~stars experiencing HBB also experience TDU (see their Table 1),
such a result is unsurprising.
This is also true for the~\karakas~yields, but that model predicts a relatively
flat~\ohno~relation owing to differences in the~\Nfourteen~yields as a
consequence of updates model inputs regarding opacity and mass loss (see
discussion in~\S~\ref{sec:yields:agb}).
In principle, there are parameterizations of~\ycc{N}~which could reproduce
the~\ohno~relation with the~\karakasten~and~\karakas~yield models - whatever
makes up the difference at a given~\oh~can be assumed to be the corresponding
CCSN yield.
Such assumptions, however, would be challenged by both the rotating and the
non-rotating SN nucleosynthesis models illustrated in
Fig.~\ref{fig:n_cc_yields}.
Despite these results, we cannot say with any confidence whether or not such
a wide mass range of stars should experience both TDU and HBB during the AGB
phase as in~\karakasten~and~\karakas.
Although this makes it difficult for these models to predict a monotonic
increase of~\no~with~\oh, there are many uncertain parameters required to
predict yields from stellar evolution models, and we have only investigated a
few of them here.
\par
In short, we find that in order to reproduce the gas-phase~\ohno~relation as
observed, our model requires the sum total N yields from both CCSNe and AGB
stars to scale roughly linearly with metallicity.
Assuming our fiducial value of~$\ycc{N} = 3.6\times10^{-4}$, we previously
illustrated this dependence in the right panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:ssp}.
With the~\cristallo~and~\ventura~models specifically, our results suggest that
these yields must increase by factors of~$2 - 3$ or that a similar fraction of
massive stars stars must collapse directly to black holes; it may also be some
mix of the two.


\subsection{The Dependence of N Production on Age and Metallicity}
\label{sec:results:t_z_dep_comp}

% fig 7 
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[scale = 0.45]{t_z_dep_comp.pdf}
\caption{
A comparison between our fiducial model with post-processing migration (black)
and variations with the time dependence (red) and metallicity dependence 
removed (blue).
To remove the time dependence, we pre-compute the AGB star yields of N from
13.2 Gyr old stellar populations as a function of metallicity as in the right
panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:ssp}, then incorporate this into the prompt CCSN yields
and set the delayed AGB star contribution to zero.
To remove the metallicity dependence, we evaluate the yields at our assumed
solar metallicity of~$Z = 0.014$ at all timesteps.
}
\label{fig:t_z_dep_comp}
\end{figure}

Despite predicting a different mass dependence for~\yagb{N}~(see Fig.
\ref{fig:agb_yield_models}), the renormalized~\cristallo~and~\ventura~yield
models both reproduce the slope of the~\ohno~relation reasonably well.
This is an indication that perhaps the metallicity dependence plays a much
more important role than the delay time in establishing this correlation.
To investigate this further, we consider two variants of our fiducial model:
one with the dependence on stellar age removed from the enrichment rate
calculations, and the other with the metallicity dependence removed.
To make this comparison more straight-forward, we use the post-processing
migration model (see discussion in~\S~\ref{sec:multizone}).
\par
To remove the age dependence, we make use of~\vice's capability to let the user
specify functional forms for nucleosynthetic yields.
We pre-compute the N yields from all AGB stars associated with a 13.2 Gyr old
stellar population as a function of progenitor metallicity in a similar fashion
as in the right panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:ssp}.
Since~\vice~works from IMF-averaged CCSN yields assumed to be injected
instantaneously following a single stellar population's formation (see
discussion in~\S~\ref{sec:yields:ccsne}), we simply add this N yields
to~\ycc{N}~and set~\yagb{N}~to zero.
In this model,~\ycc{N}~inherits a metallicity dependence from the AGB star
yields and has the exact shape as the curves in the right hand panel of
Fig.~\ref{fig:ssp}.
To remove the metallicity dependence, the procedure is much simpler: we simply
evaluate~\yagb{N}~at our assumed solar metallicity of~$Z = 0.014$ at all
timesteps.
In this model, there is still a DTD to AGB star N production inherited from the
stellar mass-lifetime relation and the mass dependence of the linear yield
model.
\par
We illustrate these model predictions in Fig.~\ref{fig:t_z_dep_comp}.
The model with no age dependence is nearly identical to the~\ohno~relation
found in our fiducial model, while the model with no metallicity dependence
is considerably different.
This indicates that the metallicity dependence indeed plays a much larger role
than the DTD in establishing the overall shape of the~\ohno~relation.
This is rather unsurprising given the short characteristic timescales of N
production ($\sim$250 Myr, see the middle panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:ssp}).
Mathematically, there is little difference in the enrichment rates if all of a
stellar population's N is produced immediately as opposed to from a sharply
declining DTD.
The metallicity dependence, however, is paramount to the~\ohno~relation, which
is expected given the results in Fig.~\ref{fig:agb_yield_models} and consistent
with previous arguments that the increase in~\no~at high~\oh~is a consequence
of secondary N production~\citep{VilaCostas1993, vanZee1998, Henry1999,
PerezMontero2009, Berg2012, Pilyugin2012, Andrews2013, HaydenPawson2021}.
\par
We clarify that this characteristic timescale applies~\textit{only} to N and
not to other elements produced in AGB stars.
The DTD of AGB star enrichment is dictated by both the stellar mass-lifetime
relation and the mass dependence of the yields from AGB stars.
In general, various elements have a different mass dependence to their AGB
star yield, and consequently, the associated DTD differs from element to
element.
N is somewhat unique in that its yields are dominated by high mass AGB stars,
and generally these yields are at the expense of C and O isotopes consumed
during HBB~\citep{Ventura2013}.
Other elements produced by the s-process often have the highest yields from
lower mass AGB stars (e.g. strontium, for which the yields as reported by
\citealp{Cristallo2011, Cristallo2015} are dominated by
$M_\text{ZAMS} = 2 - 3~\msun$ progenitors; see Fig. 5 of
\citealp{Johnson2020}).
The characteristic delay time of AGB star production will be as long as 10 Gyr
if and only if the yields are dominated by~$\sim$1~\msun stars.
Due to the steep nature of the mass-lifetime relation~\citep{Larson1974,
Maeder1989, Padovani1993}, elements whose yields are dominated by slightly more
massive AGB stars will be produced on significantly shorter timescales (e.g.
2~\msun~stars live only~$\sim$1 Gyr).
Since the AGB star DTD should in principle differ from element to element, we
caution against interpretations of AGB star nucleosynthesis which attribute
a single characteristic delay time to this enrichment channel as that is likely
only accurate for order of magnitude estimates and could lead to potentially
spurrious conclusions.


\subsection{Comparison to Stellar Abundances in the Milky Way Disc}

}
\label{fig:vincenzo_comp}
\end{figure*}

In Fig.~\ref{fig:nh_feh_vs_lookback}, we plot the evolution of N, O, and Fe
abundances in the gas phase in the~$\rgal = 4$, 8, and 12 kpc rings in our
fiducial model with diffusion migration (see discussion
in~\S~\ref{sec:multizone}).
\nh~is more correlated with~\feh~than~\oh~at all radii, and the relation
persists up to lookback times of~$\sim$10 Gyr.
This arises in part because N and Fe are both produced in significant
quantities by delayed enrichment sources while O is produced almost entirely on
short timescales by CCSNe (see discussion in~\S~\ref{sec:yields}).
Although the production timescale of N from single stellar populations is
short (see discussion in~\S~\ref{sec:yields:imf_agb}), metallicity dependent
yields require more abundance species such as O to be produced and reach an
equilibrium before N yields stabilize.
When many stellar populations are present, N abundances are somewhat limited
in how fast they can increase due to the metallicity dependent nature of AGB
star yields.
\citet{Johnson2020} found similar results regarding Fe and strontium; although
strontium production timescales from single stellar populations are shorter
than Fe, the bulk of the strontium production followed the bulk of the Fe
production in one-zone models because of the metallicity dependence of the
yields.
As a consequence of both its slight delay and its metallicity-dependent
yields, N reaches its equilibrium abundance on timescales similar to Fe rather
than O~\citep{Weinberg2017}.
Because of its prompt enrichment source with metallicity-independent
yields,~\oh~is nearly independent of lookback time as far back as~$\sim$10 Gyr
ago while~\nh~and~\feh~are not.
This N-Fe correlation turns out to be important in understanding how these
model predictions compare to stellar abundances as we discuss below.
\par
Before comparing the predictions of GCE models to abundances derived from
stellar spectra, it is essential to adjust the N abundances to account for
internal processes known to alter the surface compositions of stars.
After the CNO cycle has processed much of the C and O nuclei in a star's core
into~\Nfourteen~during its main sequence lifetime, this N-rich material is
mixed with the outer convective layers, increasing the N abundance in the
photosphere.
This effect is both predicted from theoretical models of stellar evolution and
observed in open and globular clusters~\citep{Gilroy1989, Korn2007, Lind2008,
Souto2018, Souto2019}.
Since GCE models predict the birth abundances of stars, this effect must be
taken into account.
\par
Using~\texttt{MESA} stellar evolution models~\citep{Paxton2011, Paxton2013,
Paxton2015, Paxton2018} with standard mixing prescriptions,~\citet{Vincenzo2021}
developed a prescription to approximate the birth abundances of C, N and O
and apply it to a sample of APOGEE/Kepler red giants.
They find good agreement between the APOGEE abundances and the
\citet{Dopita2016} measurements, so our fiducial model's successful reproduction
of the~\citet{Dopita2016} trend is an indication that it also successfully
reproduces the overall trend of~\no~with~\oh~found for APOGEE disc stars.
In this section, we focus on the stellar abundances, with which we can
investigate trends with age and~\ofe.
\par
Combining the~\citet{Vincenzo2021}~\no~ratios with the APOGEE stellar ages
taken from~\citet{Miglio2021}, we illustrate the~\no-age relation in bins
of~\feh~as predicted by our model in the left panel of Fig.
\ref{fig:vincenzo_comp}.
In good agreement with the observational measurements, the model predicts
the~\no-age relation to be relatively flat in bins of~\feh.
This arises as a consequence of the N-Fe correlation and the fast approach to
equilibrium in~\oh~as discussed above (see Fig.~\ref{fig:nh_feh_vs_lookback}):
a bin in~\feh~approximately corresponds to a bin in~\nh, and with~\oh~more or
less constant up to a lookback time of~$\sim$10 Gyr, these bins in~\feh~also
approximately correspond to bins in~\no.
This is an important success of the model, because with uncorrected N
abundances,~\citet{Vincenzo2021} demonstrate that the~\no-age relation exhibits
a significant negative slope at fixed~\feh~(see their Fig. 7).
\par
In the right panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:vincenzo_comp}, we compare our model
predictions to the~\no-\ofe~relation reported by~\citet{Vincenzo2021} at
fixed~\oh.
The model correctly predicts a significant inverse relationship
between~\no~and~\ofe.
This is again a consequence of the N-Fe correlation demonstrated in
Fig.~\ref{fig:nh_feh_vs_lookback}:~\nh~increases with~\feh, so at
fixed~\oh,~\no~increases as~\ofe~decreases.
This is another important success of our model;~\citet{Vincenzo2021}
demonstrate that even when stellar N abundances are corrected for internal
mixing processes, the chemical dichotomy in~\no~between the high [$\alpha$/Fe]
and low [$\alpha$/Fe] stars in the disc persists (for discussion of the
Galaxy's two distinct chemical populations see, e.g.,~\citealp{Hayden2015,
Weinberg2019, Weinberg2021, Griffith2021b}).
Although the~\citet{Johnson2021} model does not reproduce this infamous
$\alpha$ bimodality in detail, a future iteration which does should also
reproduce it for N based on these results.
\par
Quantitatively, our model slightly overpredicts~\no~in the lower metallicity
bins in both panels of Fig.~\ref{fig:vincenzo_comp}.
In general, our model occupies a noticeably wider range in~\no~than do the
\citet{Vincenzo2021} measurements at all ages and all~\ofe.
This could be a sign that the AGB star yields of N in our fiducial model scale
slightly too strongly with the total metallicity~$Z$.
Since our fiducial model assumes an exactly linear scaling of the N yield
with~$Z$, this suggests that perhaps a slightly sub-linear scaling would be
more accurate, but only barely because the discrepancies in Fig.
\ref{fig:vincenzo_comp} are at the~$\lesssim 0.1$ dex level.

\subsection{The Sources of Scatter in the~\ohno~Relation}

\label{fig:schaefer_comp}
\end{figure*}

\citet{Schaefer2020} demonstrate that intrinsic scatter in the
gas-phase~\ohno~relation is correlated with variations in the local SFE.
This is expected from simple GCE models: with slower star formation, more AGB
stars enrich the ISM by the time it reaches a given abundance, hence a
higher~\no~at a given~\oh~\citep[e.g.][]{Molla2006, Vincenzo2016a}.
However,~\citet{Schaefer2020} do not rule out radial migration as another
potential source of scatter in this relation.
Our models, taking into account the effects of stellar migration on the
enrichment rates while allowing full control over the SFH and the SFE
through~\vice, are the ideal tool with which to address this question.
\par
To this end we construct two variants of our fiducial model, one in which the
SFE exhibits 25\% sinusoidal oscillations with time, and the other with the
same 25\% oscillations in the SFR.
We modify the SFE timescale~$\tau_\star$ and the SFH~$\dot{\Sigma}_\star$ from
the fiducial case in the following manner:
\begin{equation}
\tau_\star(\rgal, t) = \tau_{\star,\text{J21}}(\rgal, t)
\left(1 + 0.25\sin\left(\frac{2\pi t}{2~\text{Gyr}}\right)\right)
\label{eq:sfe_var}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\dot{\Sigma}_\star(\rgal, t) = \dot{\Sigma}_{\star,\text{J21}}(\rgal, t)
\left(1 + 0.25\sin\left(\frac{2\pi t}{2~\text{Gyr}}\right)\right),
\label{eq:sfr_var}
\end{equation}
where~$\tau_{\star,\text{J21}}$ and~$\dot{\Sigma}_{\star,\text{J21}}$ refer to
the SFE timescale and the SFH in the fiducial model taken from
\citet{Johnson2021}.
In~\hsim, the simulation from which the migration history of our model is drawn,
we find that the overall SFE declines by a factor of~$\sim$ over the past
$\sim$9 Gyr, an effect which is already built into~$\tau_{\star,\text{J21}}$.
Additionally, there are variations in the SFE at the~$\sim$25\% level between
similar radii in the same snapshot as well as at fixed radii between successive
snapshots.
Based on this, an amplitude of 25\% should capture typical variations seen in
these quantities in hydrodynamical simulations.
However, since~\hsim~has a remarkably quiescent merger history
\citep{Zolotov2012}, this may change in response to a major accretion event.
{\color{red} We can revise these few sentences with some observational
references.}
\par
In a real galaxy, variability in the SFE and the SFR is likely non-sinusoidal
and not with constant amplitude.
A sample of galaxies will have different amplitudes and be seen at different
phases in their variability, and the impact of this on their N and O abundances
will present as intrinsic scatter in the inferred trend.
By comparing models with and without reasonable amounts of variability in these
quantities while taking into account radial migration, we can nonetheless
assess which quantities impact abundances more strongly and are thus the more
likely causes of intrinsic scatter in the observed~\ohno~relation.
\par
In the left panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:schaefer_comp}, we plot the predicted
gas-phase~\ohno~relation at high~\oh~for five snapshots covering one cycle of
fluctuations induced by variability in~$\tau_\star$ according to
equation~\refp{eq:sfe_var}.
This model predicts a~$\sim$0.15 dex dynamic range in~\no~at fixed~\oh, whereas
the fiducial model with no variability in~$\tau_\star$, shown in the dotted
lines, predicts the relation to be nearly constant over this time interval.
While this suggests that stellar migration, present in both the fiducial model
and these oscillatory variants, does not induce significant variability in
the~\ohno~plane, we demonstrate below that the effects are nonetheless
non-negligible.
The minimal impact of stellar migration traces back to the timescales of N
production from single stellar populations (see Fig.~\ref{fig:ssp} and
discussion in~\S~\ref{sec:yields:imf_agb}): with most N production occurring
within~$\sim$250 Myr of a stellar population's formation, most stars will not
migrate far from their birth radius by the time they produce most of their N,
and the resulting impact on abundances is small.
\par
The behavior in the~\ohno~plane predicted by our variant with oscillatory SFE
is driven by the constant tug-of-war between dilution and re-enrichment
associated with oscillations in~$\tau_\star$.
In this model,~$\dot{\Sigma}_\star$ is the same as in~\citet{Johnson2021}, so
it is not the SFR which varies but rather the gas supply.
When the accretion rate increases, the ISM becomes diluted by gas at a
primordial abundance, decreasing~\oh.
Because the AGB star yields of N in these models scale exactly linearly with
metallicity~$Z$ (see discussion in~\S~\ref{sec:yields:agb}), the decrease in
the N abundance due to the now lowered yields is in direct proportion to the
amount of dilution, but with a slight delay.
As a result,~\no~is only marginally affected by the fluctuations in the overall
abundance.
The variations in the~\ohno~relation that the model predicts are much more of a
consequence of variability in~\oh~than in~\no.
We demonstrate this with the black dashed line in the left panel of
Fig.~\ref{fig:schaefer_comp}, which traces the evolution of the abundances at
$\rgal = 5$ kpc over the same time interval.
In general,~\no~is affected only at the~$\sim$0.05 dex level while~\oh~varies
with an amplitude closer to~$\sim$0.25 dex.
As the gas supply falls off when~$\tau_\star$ decreases, enrichment proceeds
in a gas-starved ISM, which increases~\oh~once more, but~\no~to a lesser
extent for similar reasons, and the cycle repeats itself.
We find similar results when we vary the SFH~$\dot{\Sigma}_\star$.
In this variant of our model,~$\Sigma_\text{gas}$ and consequently the
abundances vary instead at a value of~$\tau_\star$ that varies only as much as
the adopted~$\dot{\Sigma}_\star - \Sigma_\text{gas}$ relation from
\citet{Johnson2021} dictates it should (see discussion
in~\S~\ref{sec:multizone}).
\par
In the middle and right panels of Fig.~\ref{fig:schaefer_comp}, we plot the
scatter in the gas-phase~\ohno~relation inferred observationally by
\citet{Schaefer2020}.
Using data from the MaNGA IFU survey~\citep{Bundy2015}, they measure N and O
abundances in 709,541 spaxels across 6,507 unique galaxies spanning
$10^9 - 10^{11}~\msun$ in stellar mass.
Since our model is appropriate for Milky Way mass galaxies, we focus our
comparison on the~$M_\star = 10^{10.5} - 10^{11}~\msun$ mass range
\citep{Licquia2015}, which cuts our sample sample to 197,787 individual N and O
measurements from the MaNGA IFU spaxels.
In narrow bins of~\oh, we then compute the median~\no~as well as the 16th and
84th percentiles of the~\no~distribution.
Placing the median~\no~at~$\Delta\no = 0$, the shaded regions above and below
0 in Fig.~\ref{fig:schaefer_comp} denote the difference between 16th and 84th
percentiles of the distribution in each bin.
\par
We then compare both of our oscillatory variants to the width of
the~\no~distribution by plotting the difference in~\no~at fixed~\oh~between
each variant and the fiducial model (i.e. the vertical offset between the solid
and dotted lines in the left panel, and the equivalent thereof for the model
with oscillations in~$\dot{\Sigma}_\star$).
Both models produce offsets in~\no~at fixed~\oh which, as discussed above, are
better characterized as offsets in~\oh~at an approximately fixed~\no, but the
model with oscillations in~$\dot{\Sigma}_\star$ does not predict much of an
effect at low~\oh.
This arises out of details in how we have parameterized these models (see
discussion below).
Fig.~\ref{fig:schaefer_comp} suggests that our oscillatory models have an
effect in the~\ohno~plane with an amplitude comparable to the width of the
relation derived observationally by~\citet{Schaefer2020}.
This is consistent with their argument that variations in the local SFE are
the primary source of intrinsic scatter.
However, our models suggest that the effects of stellar migration are still
non-negligible.
These effects are illustrated in the complex features on the curves in
Fig.~\ref{fig:schaefer_comp}; without migration, they would be smooth and
featureless as in Fig.~\ref{fig:no_oh_predictions} where we made use of the
post-processing migration model.
Fig.~\ref{fig:schaefer_comp} suggests that an amplitude of~$\sim$0.05 dex is
not uncommon, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:no_oh_timeevol} and discussed
in~\S~\ref{sec:results:fiducial}.
With our oscillatory models inducing~$\Delta\no \approx 0.1$ dex, migration is
a smaller but nonetheless non-negligible effect.
\par
The difference in predictions by our two oscillatory models at low~\oh~is a
consequence of the mathematical form of~$\tau_{\star,\text{J21}}$ and the fact
that we have specified our SFH a priori as opposed to the gas supply or the
infall history.
The low~\oh~end of the~\ohno~relation arises at large~\rgal due to the
metallicity gradient.
At these radii, our model predicts gas surface densities that are in the
$\dot{\Sigma}_\star \propto \Sigma_\text{gas}^{3.6}$ portion of our adopted
$\dot{\Sigma}_\star - \Sigma_\text{gas}$ relation (see equation
\ref{eq:sflaw_indeces} and discussion in~\S~\ref{sec:multizone}).
However, since these models run from a specified SFH, it is not that the SFH is
a strong function of the gas supply but rather that the gas supply is a weak
function of the SFH.
As a consequence, 25\% oscillations in~$\dot{\Sigma}_\star$ have minimal impact
on the ISM gas supply and thus the predicted abundances with how we have
parameterized this model.
At smaller~\rgal~(i.e. higher~\oh),~$\Sigma_\text{gas}$ varies more strongly
with~$\dot{\Sigma}_\star$, and as expected the impact on abundances is more
substantial.
If we were to adopt an alternate form of the
$\dot{\Sigma}_\star - \Sigma_\text{gas}$ relation, such as a purely linear or
single power-law formalism as in many other GCE models
\citep[e.g.][]{Spitoni2019, Spitoni2021, Grisoni2021}, then this effect would
be seen at all~\oh~when~$\dot{\Sigma}_\star$ oscillates.
Alternatively, we expect similar results if we were to run an equivalent model
through~\vice~where we specify the infall history a priori as it would allow
more direct specification of the amount of dilution during each oscillation.
