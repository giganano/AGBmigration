These choices are based on a mix of theoretical and empirical considerations.
For a \cite{Kroupa2001} IMF, the solar metallicity CCSN yields of
\cite{Limongi2006} and Griffith et al.\ (\citeyear{Griffith2021x},
based on \citealt{Sukhbold2016} models with forced explosions)
predict $\yocc = 0.017$ or 0.018, respectively, if all stars from 
$8-120 M_\odot$ explode.  The value of $\yocc=0.015$ allows for a modest 
amount of black hole formation but implicitly assumes that most massive
stars explode.\footnote{If all stars from 8-40$M_\odot$ explode and all
more massive stars collapse, then the \cite{Sukhbold2016} models with 
forced explosions yield $\yocc=0.013$ \citep{Griffith2021x}.}
In chemical evolution models, this choice of yield also leads to good
agreement with the observationally inferred D/H ratio \citep{Linsky2006}
of the local interstellar medium, while substantially lower $\yocc$ leads
to disagreement \citep{Weinberg2017b}.

Given this value of $\yocc$, our adopted value of $\yfecc$ gives
$\ofe \approx 0.43$ for stars with pure CCSN enrichment, in good agreement
with ``high-$\alpha$ plateau'' of disk stars found by \cite{Ramirez2013};
matching the APOGEE plateau at $\ofe \approx 0.35$ 
(see, e.g., Fig.~6 of \cite{Hasselquist2021}) would require a slightly
higher $\yfecc=0.0014$.
Type Ia supernova models predict minimal O yields, justifying $\yoIa=0$.  
The choice of $\yIafe = 0.00214$ then leads to good agreement with the
observed $\ofe$ values of low-$\alpha$ thin-disk stars given the star 
formation assumptions used by \cite{Johnson2021}; for analytic
discussion see \S 3.1 of \cite{Weinberg2017}.
For a SNIa Fe yield of $0.77 M_\odot$ \citep{Iwamoto1999}, this
$\yfeIa$ corresponds to a time-integrated SNIa rate
$R_{\rm Ia} = 2.7 \times 10^{-3} M_\odot^{-1}$ (i.e., 2.7 supernovae
per $1000 M_\odot$ of star formation), which is moderately higher than
the value of $2.2 \times 10^{-3} M_\odot^{-1}$ inferred by \cite{Maoz2012}
% https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012PASA...29..447M/abstract
for a \cite{Kroupa2001} IMF.  Our choice of yields is internally consistent
and reproduces many Milky Way observations \citep{Johnson2021}, but
many of the GCE model predictions would be little changed if we lowered
$\yocc$, $\yfecc$, and $\yfeIa$ by a common factor and reduced the
level of outflows.  We return to this point in the context of N yields
in \S\ref{sec:XXX}.
