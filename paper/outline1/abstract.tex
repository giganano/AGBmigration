We use a multi-ring galactic chemical evolution model to probe the 
astrophysical production of nitrogen (N) in the Milky Way. 
This approach treats individual annuli in the Galaxy disc as a conventional 
one-zone model, and to include the effects of radial migration, stellar 
populations move between annuli in a manner informed by star particles from a 
hydrodynamical simulation. 
We find that no published set of AGB star yields is able to reproduce the 
gas-phase [N/O]-[O/H] relation as observed; those that reproduce the 
qualitative trend still require an artificial enhancement of their N yields by 
factors of~$2 - 3$ to get the normalization correct. 
We demonstrate that, with a viable set of AGB star yields, our model is able to 
reproduce many of the observed correlations between N, O, and Fe abundances for 
stars when the N abundances are corrected for internal mixing processes within 
stars. 
With any of these yields, N production timescales are sufficiently short such 
that stellar migration is only a minimal source of intrinsic scatter in the 
observed [N/O]-[O/H] relation. 
Modest variations in the star formation rate and star formation efficiency 
produce considerably larger variations in the gas phase N and O abundances, 
consistent with previous observational arguments. 
Our models run using the publicly available~\texttt{Versatile Integrator for 
Chemical Evolution} (\texttt{VICE};~\url{https://pypi.org/project/vice}).
