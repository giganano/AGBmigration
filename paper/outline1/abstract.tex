We use a multi-ring galactic chemical evolution model to probe the 
astrophysical production of nitrogen (N) in the Milky Way. 
This approach treats individual annuli in the Galaxy disc as a conventional 
one-zone model, and to include the effects of radial migration, stellar 
populations move between annuli in a manner informed by a hydrodynamical 
simulation. 
We test how well different AGB star nucleosynthetic yield models for N can 
reproduce the observed [N/O]-[O/H] relation. 
We find that no published set of AGB star yields is able to reproduce the data; 
those that reproduce the qualitative trend still require an artificial 
enhancement of their N yields by factors of a few. 
We find that N production timescales are sufficiently short such that stellar 
migration is only a minimal source of intrinsic scatter in the observed 
[N/O]-[O/H] relation. 
Typical variations in the star formation rate and star formation efficiency 
produce considerably larger variations in the gas phase N and O abundances, 
consistent with previous observational arguments. 
We demonstrate that when a viable AGB star yield table is adopted, our model is 
able to reproduce many of the observed correlations between N, O, and Fe 
abundances for stars when the N abundances are corrected for internal mixing 
processes. 
Our models run using the publicly available~\texttt{Versatile Integrator for 
Chemical Evolution} (\texttt{VICE};~\url{https://pypi.org/project/vice}).
